Data Projects with source code using Python3 

1. Data Cleanisng -Project 1 : For basic data cleanup using Pandas.
    Using the Vectorisation to avoid loops for column splitting, dropping N/A and nulls.

2. Analysing Gender Gaps: Using Matplotlib to analyse the gender gaps in different streams of study visually.

3. Serialisation and deserialisation of data: 
   Using JSON library to read data from a data source (JSON File/ API endpoint). 
   Selecting the keys to select the required subset, flattening and exporting the result to CSV files. 
   Dataset used for this can be found here.

4. Steps for converting a JSON Response to Dataframe in Pandas for Data Manipulation:
    Steps to read data from an endpoint using REQUESTS library, then parsing it with JSON to a more readable format and finally converting to Dataframe in Pandas for further           manipulation.
